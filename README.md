# mBot Project

## What is this project for?
This is a project for CG1111A by Team 3, Section 4.

## Project Description
We programmed and wired a robot with the capability to autonomously navigate through a randomly generated maze.  The robot's functionality must be  achieved through the integration of ultrasonic sensors and an infrared sensor, ensuring the maintenance of a straight course.
It should be able to decode colours using an LDR circuit we built and turn in a particular direction determined by the colour.
